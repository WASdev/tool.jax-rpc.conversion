# tool.jax-rpc.conversion

The WebSphere Liberty JAX-RPC Conversion Tool for Maven is a Maven plugin that helps convert applications that use the JAX-RPC technology 
to enable them to run on WebSphere Liberty. The applications are modified to use the JAX-WS technology instead.

This tool is currently in closed beta and available by invitation only.

If you have any questions about the tool, or are having issues with the tool, open a new issue and we will respond as soon as possible.
